# Polling App - Frontend

## Overview

## Features
- **Teacher Features**:
  - Create polls with options and set a timer for voting.
  - View real-time results as students vote.
  - View poll history.
  - Kick students out of the room.

- **Student Features**:

  - Vote in real-time on polls.
  - Redirect to a "kicked out" page if removed by the teacher.

## Tech Stack
- **React** (with Vite for fast development)
